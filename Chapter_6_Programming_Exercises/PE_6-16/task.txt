Daphne invests $100 at 10% simple interest. (That is, every year, the investment earns an interest equal to 10% of the original investment.) Deirdre invests $100 at 5% interest compounded annually. (That is, interest is 5% of the current balance, including previous addition of interest.) Write a program that finds how many years it takes for the value
of Deirdre’s investment to exceed the value of Daphne’s investment. Also show the two values at that time.
