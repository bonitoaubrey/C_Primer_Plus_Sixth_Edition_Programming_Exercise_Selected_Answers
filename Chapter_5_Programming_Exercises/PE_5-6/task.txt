Now modify the program of Programming Exercise 5 so that it computes the sum of the squares of the integers. (If you prefer, how much money you receive if you get $1 the first day, $4 the second day, $9 the third day, and so on. This looks like a much better deal!) C doesnâ€™t have a squaring function, but you can use the fact that the square of n is n * n.

5. Change the program addemup.c (Listing 5.13), which found the sum of the first 20 integers. (If you prefer, you can think of addemup.c as a program that calculates how much money you get in 20 days if you receive $1 the first day, $2 the second day, $3 the third day, and so on.) Modify the program so that you can tell it interactively how far the calculation should proceed. That is, replace the 20 with a variable that is read in.

Listing 5.13 The addemup.c Program
________________________________________________________________________
/* addemup.c -- five kinds of statement */
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)                      /* finds sum of first 20 integers */
{
    int count, sum;                 /* declaration statement */
    count = 0;                      /* assignment statement */
    sum = 0;                        /* ditto */
    while (count++ < 20)            /* while */
        sum = sum + count;          /* statement */
    printf("sum = %d\n", sum);      /* function statement */
    return 0;                       /* return statement */
}
